# tank-tussle
A top down 2 player tank fighting game, developed using the Pygame Library.

Structure:
  This was my first time using the Pygame library to create something not just out of a tutorial. So as a result, the structure is horrid.
  Everything is in one file, there are classes but they dont have files for them. Lots of case statements and nested for loops. 

## using a venv
- ```bash
  virtualenv venv
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- After that you're ready - `python main.py`



Features: 
  * Local 2 Player Versus mode
  * Random Maze Generation
  * Projectile Bouncing
  * Tank Controls (terrible)
  * Destructible Environment (i swear)
  * Sounds and Music (all sourced from free sound websites and modulated)
  * Main Menu
  * Restart System
